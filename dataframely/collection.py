class Collection(BaseCollection, ABC):
    """Base class for all collections of data frames with a predefined schema.

    A collection is comprised of a set of *members* which are collectively "consistent",
    meaning they the collection ensures that invariants are held up *across* members.
    This is different to :mod:`dataframely` schemas which only ensure invariants
    *within* individual members.

    In order to properly ensure that invariants hold up across members, members must
    have a "common primary key", i.e. there must be an overlap of at least one primary
    key column across all members. Consequently, a collection is typically used to
    represent "semantic objects" which cannot be represented in a single data frame due
    to 1-N relationships that are managed in separate data frames.

    A collection must only have type annotations for :class:`~dataframely.LazyFrame`s
    with known schema:

    .. code:: python

        class MyCollection(dy.Collection):
            first_member: dy.LazyFrame[MyFirstSchema]
            second_member: dy.LazyFrame[MySecondSchema]

    Besides, it may define *filters* (c.f. :meth:`~dataframely.filter`) and arbitrary
    methods.

    Note:
        The :mod:`dataframely` mypy plugin ensures that the dictionaries passed to class
        methods contain exactly the required keys.

    Attention:
        Do NOT use this class in combination with ``from __future__ import annotations``
        as it requires the proper schema definitions to ensure that the collection is
        implemented correctly.

        Just like sampling for schemas, **this method should only be used for testing**.
        Contrary to sampling for schemas, the core difficulty when sampling related

            num_rows: The number of rows to sample for each member. If this is set to
                ``None``, the number of rows is inferred from the length of the
                overrides.
            overrides: The overrides to set values in member schemas. The overrides must
                be provided as a list of samples. The structure of the samples must be

                    }

                *Any* member/value can be left out and will be sampled automatically.
                Note that overrides for columns of members that are annotated with
                ``inline_for_sampling=True`` can be supplied on the top-level instead
                of in a nested dictionary.

        superfluous columns and casting to the correct dtypes for all input data frames.

        You should typically use :meth:`validate` or :meth:`filter` to obtain instances
        of the collection as this method does not guarantee that the returned collection
        upholds any invariants. Nonetheless, it may be useful to use in instances where
        it is known that the provided data adheres to the collection's invariants.

        Args:
            data: The data for all members. The dictionary must contain exactly one
                entry per member with the name of the member as key.

        Returns:
            The initialized collection.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If an insufficient set of input data frames is provided, i.e. if
                any required member of this collection is missing in the input.

        Attention:
            For lazy frames, casting is not performed eagerly. This prevents collecting
            the lazy frames' schemas but also means that a call to :meth:`collect`
            further down the line might fail because of the cast and/or missing columns.

        Attention:

def deserialize_collection(data: str) -> type[Collection]:
    """Deserialize a collection from a JSON string.

    This method allows to dynamically load a collection from its serialization, without
    having to know the collection to load in advance.

    Args:
        data: The JSON string created via :meth:`Collection.serialize`.

    Returns:
        The collection loaded from the JSON data.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the schema format version is not supported.

    Attention:
        The returned collection **cannot** be used to create instances of the
        collection as filters cannot be correctly recovered from the serialized format
        as of polars 1.31. Thus, you should only use static information from the
        returned collection.

    Attention:
        This functionality is considered unstable. It may be changed at any time
        without it being considered a breaking change.

    See also:
        :meth:`Collection.serialize` for additional information on serialization.
